# Contributing to PS

Thanks a bunch for reading this and thinking about contributing back to this project.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make 
via a Github issue before making a change so that the community is aware of what people
are working on, and thus may collaborate.

## Choosing a Problem

There is no definitive way to choose a problem that you may want to add to this repository.
Feel free to add problems that you feel will help every user here - ones that are not usually
written/blogged about - something interesting that you encountered, or worked upon. In case 
of confusion, feel free to raise a pull-request and get the discussion started.

## Pull Requests

Following is the basic guide to follow for raising pull requests:

* Please do not overwrite anyone else's changes
* When making a change to an existing article - please add/update the change history at the
top of the article
* The pull request title and description should detail as to what the pull request is all
about
* Do provide links and references wherever applicable
* Do update the README file and categorize your request
* The post should not redirect back to another page for discussion and code examples
* Agree to the license for this repo - MIT
* Lastly, please do not copy/paste Wikipedia and/or other's creation. Provide credits wherever due

## Language Choice

There is no standard code language for this repository. The preferred language is `Java`
as I am more fluent with it. All **non-Java** code contributions are more that welcome as
well.

* Please add the code example language after the link to the topic in README.md file so
that viewers are aware of what the examples are in.

* In case you are adding code examples in another language for an existing solution, please
add language option to the same title via a child-list element. For example:

```
* Designing a Google Reader
  * Java
  * Go
  * Python
```

## Discussion/Coding Conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* We break text lines at near-about 80 characters of width
* Prefer to indent using soft-tabs, using 2 spaces for tabs
* Do provide links to terms and topics of interest
